    PureOKRs is storing names to make it possible to show you who the other
    users from your company are, and to make it possible to assign OKRs to
    individuals. In addition, email addresses are stored in order to send
    invitation emails to new users and to send emails in case someone needs to
    reset their password. Both names and emails are deleted permanently when
    users are deleted from PureOKRs.

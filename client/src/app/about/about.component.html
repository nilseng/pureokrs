    What are Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)?
  </h5>

    <p>
      It is a goal setting methodology for operationalizing a company's
      strategy. Objectives are main goals, while key results are what you need
      to accomplish to reach the main goals. OKRs are organized in a tree
      structure starting with high level OKRs which are broken down into smaller
      and smaller OKRs as the tree is traversed. The methodology is used by all
      kinds of companies - from small tech startups to industrial giants.

    <p>
      There are lots of OKR tools out there. However, most of them are
      unnecessary complex and make it difficult to maintain the elegant
      simplicity of the OKR methodology. The purpose of PureOKRs is to provide a
      tool that helps you keep track of your Objectives and Key Results. No
      more, no less.
